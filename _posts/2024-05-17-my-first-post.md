# Welcome! Let me introduce myselft!

Hi, my name is Rafael and welcome to my personal github webpage. I'm a 17 years old Luso-Brazilian student learning IT and at the moment I'm making this post I'm doing my first internship at Arditi.

If you want to check some of my works I'll list them down here:

## What I like?

I normally like to play some games, but I also like to know about cars and motorbikes and computer science (Even if I'm not very good at the last one, but I keep trying to know more things XD).

I also like alot to listen to some music, I play music my entire day, I work with music (sometimes, it dependes on the level of concentration I need), I play some (car) games with music, and I play music on my head when I'm bored.

I like to learn new things, specialy about technology and of course about cars.

## What you will see on this webpage?

Right now i don't know exactly what to post here, but I'm thinking about posting some things about cars and about IT like tutorials and curiosities. What do you think? If you have a sugestion, please contact me by writing a letter to this E-mail.

See you next time!
